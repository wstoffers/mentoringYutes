## Notes and Examples
- [Lighting from above has advantages](https://digital-photography-school.com/3-lighting-setups-headshots/)
    - Too high a light and you'll lose the catch lights
    - Light source slightly above eye level is ideal
    - Get subtle shadows under the chin (accentuates jaw, hides double chin)
    - Light skin and dark hair (if hair is down) means no negative fill needed, but might want fill and/or hair light instead
