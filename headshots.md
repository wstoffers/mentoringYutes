## Notes and Examples
- [Lighting from above has advantages](https://digital-photography-school.com/3-lighting-setups-headshots/)
    - Too high a light and you'll lose the catch lights
    - Light source slightly above eye level is ideal
    - Get subtle shadows under the chin (accentuates jaw, hides double chin)
    - Light skin and dark hair (if hair is down) means no negative fill needed, but might want fill and/or hair light instead

- [Large, round catch light examples](http://www.ulearnphotography.com/studio-lighting/how-to-shoot-actor-headshot-model-portraits/)
    - 5:35

    - Rectangular catch lights, first one then two

- [Advice from an agent and a casting director](https://www.stewartwhitley.com/news-blog/http/wwwbackstagecom/interview/8-tips-better-headshots-agent-and-cd/utmcampaigneditorial20postsutmcontent18553891utmmediumsocialutmsourcetwitter)
    - The eyes are the most important element of any headshot so face needs to be the focus
    - Most headshots should be neutral representation of who the actor is in their daily life
        - Is this just for auditioning actors?
        - If not for someone who's auditioning for unknown/future roles, instead want a representation of the specific character or specific line of work?

- [What casting directors supposedly want](https://www.nycastings.com/headshot-fixes-every-casting-director-wishes-you-would-do/)
    - It's a captured moment of you acting
    - It's a tiny piece of art, meant to represent the art that you create, and what makes you unique as an artist

- [Good landscape headshot example](https://actinginlondon.co.uk/acting-headshots-guide/)
    - Guy with the curls, heavy bokeh background

- [Many examples](https://www.jordanmatter.com/photography/head-shots/actor-headshots)
    - Especially liked some examples after filtering by female for gender
    - Tara Westwood was good except no depth/separation on the right side of the frame
    - Jennifer Onvie was great and very dramatic even though the catch lights are very small
    - Jedediah Bila seems good too even though it's not straight on, though are the catch lights distracting?

- [Advice from an acting coach](https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/tips-better-headshot-11730/)
    - Just like with acting it's all about the eyes and what's happening behind them
    - Strong inner thoughts, implying backstory and a life behind the eyes
    - Bring out a slight squint and strong piercing eyes

- [Examples with lots of neck tension](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141013143030-11257534-how-to-look-your-best-for-a-headshot/?articleId=8449492689580492922)
